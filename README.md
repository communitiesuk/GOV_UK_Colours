## Trying out changes to the package from other repositories

When you want to make changes to the package to use in another repository, it can be useful to see what changes would look like before commiting to the package repo. You can do this by making changes directly to the package files in the conda environment of the repository you're working in.

- Open the file you wish to change in the conda environment
- You can do this by clicking into functions from the package in your IDE or by finding the file you wish to change in your file system, e.g.
 ```.../anaconda3/envs/local_government_dashboard/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gov_uk_dashboards/components/...```
- Make the changes to the package file and you should see the changes in your localhost on refresh

When you're happy, you can make the changes on a branch in the package repo and install it locally to check it works as expected when imported before merging into main in the package repo:
- You can update the *environment.yml* to point at your branch or run ```pip install``` with the url:
    ```git+https://github.com/communitiesuk/pkg_gov_uk_dashboards.git@<your-branch>```
